# React e-commerce Project (named as estore)

A complete custom UI-based e-commerce project made with react. I named it "estore.com" just a dummy name. Developed this project during my internship period at Nisum, Karachi. It was fun working with react component-based web apps and core javascript. It's a complete e-commerce project that has all features an e-commerce website must have. Like adding products to the cart, product detail view, cart items quantity, product category, product sorting, checkout, search item, and more. Further details are mentioned below.
